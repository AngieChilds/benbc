      <h3>What We Believe</h3>
  <p>Everything that we do as believers and as a community of believers should be consistent with the teaching of the Word of God. While good people differ on the finer points of Bible doctrine, this is where we stand as a congregation of believers committed to the lordship of Christ and His Word, the Bible.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>
<h5>THE WORD OF GOD</h5>
We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, completely inspired of God and without error in the original manuscripts, written under inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and providentially preserved by God for His people, and that it is the final and only rule of authority in all matters of faith and conduct.
<b>2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20,21; Mark 13:31; John 8:31,32; John 20:31; Acts 20:32</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>THE TRINITY</h5>
We believe that there is one living and true God, eternally existing in three persons; and that these persons are equal in every divine perfection, and that they execute distinct, but harmonious offices in the work of creation, providence and redemption.
<b>Gen. 1:1,26; John 1:1,3; Matt. 28:19; John 4:24; Rom. 1:19,20; Eph. 4:5,6</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>GOD THE FATHER</h5>
We believe in God the Father, an infinite, personal Spirit, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power and love. We believe that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of men, that He hears and answers prayer, and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ.
<b>Luke 10:21,22; Matt. 23:9; John 3:16; 6:27; Rom. 1:7; 1 Tim. 1:1,2; 2:5,6; 1 Peter 1:3; Rev.1:6</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>JESUS CHRIST</h5>
We believe in Jesus Christ, God's only begotten Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit, fully God and fully man. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning death for His people, bodily resurrection, ascension into heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, and personal visible return to the earth as He promised.
<b>Matt. 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-38; John 1:1; 20:28; Rom. 9:5; 8:46; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 2:21-23; John 20:30,31; Matt. 20:28; Eph. 1:4; Acts 1:11; Rom. 5:6-8; 6:9,10; Heb. 7:25; 9:28; 1 Tim. 3:16</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>THE HOLY SPIRIT</h5>
We believe in the Holy Spirit who came forth from the Father and Son to convict the world of sin, righteousness and judgment, and to regenerate, sanctify, and empower all who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that the Holy Spirit indwells every believer in Christ, and that He is an abiding helper, teacher and guide.
<b>John 14:16,17,26; 15:26,27; 16:9-14; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; Gal. 5:22-26</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>REGENERATION</h5>
We believe that man was created by God in His own image; that he sinned and thereby incurred physical, spiritual and eternal death, which is separation from God; that as a consequence, all human beings are born with a sinful nature and are sinners by choice, and therefore under condemnation. We believe that those who repent and forsake sin and trust Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, are regenerated by the Holy Spirit and become new creatures, are delivered from condemnation and receive eternal life.
<b>Gen. 1:26; 5:2; Gen.3; Gen. 2:17; 3:19; Eccl. 2:11; John 3:14; 5:24; John 5:30; 7:13; 8:12; 10:26; Rom. 9:22; 2 Thess. 1:9; Rev. 19:3,20; 20:10; 14:15; 21:18; Ps. 51:7; Jer. 17:9; James 1:14; Rom. 3:19; 5:19; Prov. 28:13; 1 John 1:9; John 3:16; John 1:13; 2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 8:1</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>THE CHURCH</h5>
We believe in the universal church, a living spiritual body of which Jesus Christ is the Head, and all regenerated persons are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company of believers in Jesus Christ, baptized on a credible profession of faith, and associated for worship, work and fellowship. We believe that God has laid upon the members of the local church the primary task of giving the gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world.
<b>Eph. 2:19-22; Acts 1:8; Eph. 5:19-21; Acts 2:42; Heb. 10:23-25</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>CHRISTIAN CONDUCT</h5>
We believe that a Christian should live for the glory of God and the well-being of his fellow men; that his conduct should be blameless before the world; that he should be a faithful steward of his possessions; and that he should seek to realize for himself and others the full stature of maturity in Christ.
<b>1 Cor. 10:31; Rom. 12:1-3; Heb.12: 1,2; John 14:15, 23,24; 1 John 2:3-6; 2 Cor. 9:6-9; 1 Cor. 4:2; Col. 1:9,10</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>THE ORDINANCES</h5>
We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has committed two ordinances to the local church; baptism and the Lord's Supper. We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of the believer in water into the Name of the Triune God. We believe that the Lord's Supper was instituted by the Lord Jesus, in remembrance of His death. We believe that these two ordinances should be observed and administered until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.
<b>Matt. 28:18-20; Rom. 6:3-5; 1 Cor. 11:23-26</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</h5>
We believe that every human being has direct relations with God, and is responsible to God alone in all matters of faith; that each church is independent and must be free from interference by any ecclesiastical or political authority; that therefore Church and State must be kept separate as having different functions, each fulfilling its duties free from dictation or patronage of the other.
<b>1 Tim. 2:5; Rom. 14:7-9,12</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>CHURCH COOPERATION</h5>
We believe that local churches can best promote the cause of Jesus Christ by cooperating with one another. Conferences or Unions may be recognized between those who hold to similar views of doctrine. This cooperation is purely voluntary.
<b>Acts 15:36,41; 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:1; Gal. 1:1-3; Rev. 1:4,10,11</b>
</li>
  <li>
<h5>SPIRITUAL GIFTS</h5>
Every believer receives at conversion grace gift(s) from the Holy Spirit, and these are to be used to prepare the people of God for works of service in order that the body of Christ will be built up and reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, thus becoming spiritually mature, and attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. The necessity of speaking in tongues and other sign miracles has fallen away with the availability and completion of the Holy Scriptures.
<b>Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:1-31; Eph. 4:7-13; 1 Peter 4:10,11; 1 Cor. 12:29-31; 13-14</b>
</li>
  <li>
    <h5>LAST THINGS</h5>
We believe in the personal and visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ to earth, and the establishment of His kingdom. We believe in the resurrection of the body, the final judgment, the everlasting joy of the righteous and the endless suffering of the wicked.
<b>Matt. 16:27; Mark 14:62; John 14:3; Acts 1:11; Phil. 3:20; 1 Thess. 4:15; 2 Tim. 4:1; Titus 2:13; 1 Cor. 4:5; 1 Cor. 15; 2 Thess. 1:7-10; Rev. 20: 4-6, 11-15</b>
